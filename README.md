## 🧠 TumorX: Brain Tumor Detection via Deep Learning

An end-to-end deep learning system for automated brain tumor analysis using MRI scans. TumorX performs both **segmentation** and **classification** independently, leveraging U-Net and CNN architectures. Designed for academic and clinical research, it features a modular Streamlit interface and AI-powered PDF reporting.

---

### 🚀 Features

- **Tumor Segmentation** using U-Net with 90%+ Dice coefficient
- **Tumor Classification** using CNN with 95%+ accuracy
- **Streamlit Interface** for real-time image upload and result visualization
- **AI-Powered PDF Reports** with tumor-specific insights and risk assessment
- **Modular Pipeline** for independent execution of segmentation and classification

---

### 🧬 Tumor Types Classified

- **Glioma** – Irregular malignant tumors from glial cells
- **Meningioma** – Well-defined tumors from meninges
- **Pituitary Tumor** – Central region tumors near pituitary gland
- **No Tumor** – Healthy MRI scans

---

### 🧠 Architecture Overview

#### 🔹 U-Net (Segmentation)
- Encoder-decoder with skip connections
- Loss: Binary Cross-Entropy + Dice Loss
- Metrics: Accuracy, Dice, IoU

#### 🔹 CNN (Classification)
- 4 Conv layers + MaxPooling + Dense + Softmax
- Loss: Categorical Cross-Entropy
- Metrics: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, ROC, PR Curve

### 🗂️ Dataset

- **Source**: Kaggle Brain Tumor MRI Dataset
- **Total Images**: 4,500 (segmentation + classification)
- **Segmentation**: 2,000 image–mask pairs
- **Classification**: 4 classes, labeled via folder names
- **Preprocessing**: Resizing, normalization, augmentation (flip, rotate, zoom, noise)
